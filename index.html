              <p>
              <p>As a game designer working on "Strong Hand," I had the unique opportunity to help bring a highly
                immersive and strategic card game to life. Set in the gritty underworld of the 1920s, the game merges
                the tense atmosphere of organized crime with tactical card mechanics, creating an experience where every
                decision could mean the difference between life and death.<br><br>

                In this group project, I collaborated with other designers and developers using Unity and C# to build a
                system where strategy, luck, and player interaction come together. The game places players in the role
                of a caporegime, an individual who has betrayed their family and is forced to prove themselves once more
                in a deadly game of cards. With each match, players must outwit their opponent, balancing the use of
                powerful cards with the looming risk of danger, because in the world of "Strong Hand," every choice has
                a consequence.<br><br>

                One of the core elements that I contributed to was the card abilities system. Each card is designed with
                a unique effect, from forcing your opponent into dangerous situations, like cutting off a finger or
                facing a glassing, to the nail-biting decision of pulling out a roulette card and hoping you have a
                bullet in the chamber.<br><br>

                It was thrilling to design a game where the tension of every move could decide life or death, and Iâ€™m
                proud to have been part of a team that created a game that challenges players to think strategically,
                but also embrace the randomness and danger of the underworld.</p>

              <p>
              <p>As a game designer for Just a Chill Fishing Game, I had the exciting challenge of designing and
                developing a relaxing yet engaging experience within just 48 hours as part of the Global Game Jam (GGJ).
                Using Unity and Aseprite, our team created a charming game that combines strategic fishing with a
                relaxing atmosphere.<br><br>

                In this project, I contributed to both the gameplay mechanics and overall design. The player controls a
                snapping turtle, tasked with completing fishing orders for Marty, a friendly marmot. To create an
                immersive yet simple experience, I focused on balancing game progression with a chill vibe. The player
                needs to cast, reel, and avoid obstacles like bubbles, all while upgrading their gear to fish in deeper
                waters and unlock new challenges.<br><br>

                I worked on designing the core gameplay loop, ensuring it was intuitive yet rewarding. The key challenge
                was to make sure that the mechanics of casting, reeling, and skill upgrades felt smooth and fun within a
                tight 48-hour deadline. I also collaborated with the art team to ensure that the visual assets were
                consistent with the game's relaxing theme, making use of pixel art created in Aseprite.<br><br>

                Despite the time constraints, our team worked efficiently, and the result was a game that felt polished
                and cohesive. Just a Chill Fishing Game became a testament to our ability to innovate and collaborate
                under pressure, showcasing our ability to craft a fun, accessible experience in just 48 hours. It was a
                rewarding experience to work on something so different from my usual projects, and it reminded me of the
                joy of creating games that bring people a sense of calm and enjoyment.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Jack. Iâ€™m a current third-year Game Design student, close to finishing my BSc (Hons) in Games
          Development, with a strong passion for video game development. I hold a National Certificate (NC) in Video
          Game Development and a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Digital Design & Development. With years of experience
          working in Unity, C#, and GameMaker Language (GML), I thrive on creating engaging interactive experiences with
          innovative gameplay mechanics. I specialize in building intuitive player experiences and meaningful player
          interaction. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on expanding my skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and exploring
          different genres for creating games with the aim of bringing more complex, dynamic interactions to the games I
          create. As a game designer, I value the process of refining mechanics and crafting memorable player journeys.
