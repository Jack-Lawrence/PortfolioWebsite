               data-game-desc="Strong Hand was a two-term project completed during my third year at university. We worked with an external client, holding monthly meetings to share progress and receive industry feedback. I acted as the main contact for the client, managing additional emails and questions outside of scheduled meetings, which gave me responsibility to represent the team’s updates.<br><br>In the first term, my two fellow game designers and I focused on pre-production—designing the game’s setting, rules, systems, and requirements. This groundwork allowed programmers and artists to begin work on the initial production of the vertical slice.<br><br>During the second term, the focus shifted to production—polishing the vertical slice and adding art and final details. With less design work needed, I supported the programmers by picking up tasks to help keep the project on track.<br><br>Throughout the project, I collaborated with 10 other students, and we developed a strong team dynamic by the end of the module.<br><br>Skills gained:<br>• Client communication and stakeholder management<br>• Project coordination and team leadership<br>• Collaborative teamwork in a multidisciplinary setting<br>• Game design and system development<br>• Flexibility in adapting to production needs<br>• Time management and deadline adherence"

I worked alongside four fellow third-year students, a mix of designers and programmers, to plan, design, code, create art, and add sound to bring the game to life under a tight deadline.<br><br>The theme for the jam was 'Bubbles,' which we used as the core lose condition — if players accidentally popped a bubble while fishing, the fish they had on their hook would be lost and they’d return to the surface. This added a bit of tension to an otherwise relaxing gameplay loop, giving it a unique twist.<br><br>The jam was an intense but rewarding experience that taught us a lot about rapid prototyping, scope management, and how to prioritise the features that really matter. With only 48 hours, we had to make quick decisions about what to include and what to cut to ensure the game was polished and playable by the submission deadline.<br><br>Unfortunately, due to red weather warnings at the time, we couldn’t attend the in-person showcase at the university. However, we’ve since had classmates play and provide feedback, and many reported getting around 15 minutes of solid gameplay out of it, which, for a game jam title, we’re really proud of.<br><br>Skills gained:<br>• Rapid prototyping and scope management<br>• Cross-discipline collaboration under pressure<br>• Time-constrained decision making<br>• Basic sound design and asset integration<br>• Creative problem-solving within theme restrictions<br>• Playtesting and interpreting feedback post-jam"

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jack, a fourth-year Game Design student working towards a first-class degree in Games Development. 
          I’ve always been passionate about creating games that offer players unique, engaging experiences. 
          Along the way, I’ve earned an NC in Video Game Development and an HND in Digital Design & Development, 
          and I’ve built strong skills in Unity, C#, and GameMaker Language (GML).
          <br><br>
          I love experimenting with mechanics, refining ideas through iteration, and finding ways to make 
          gameplay feel both intuitive and meaningful. Right now, my dissertation explores how power imbalances 
          affect player behaviour and social interaction in cooperative games, combining my interests in multiplayer design 
          and player psychology. Outside of game development you’ll usually find me at the gym, climbing Munros, or playing the latest video games.
